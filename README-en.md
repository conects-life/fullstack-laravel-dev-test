## üåê Data Source to Use

The data source from which to extract the information for import is:

üîó [https://sandbox.oxylabs.io/products](https://sandbox.oxylabs.io/products)

- `image_url`  
- `description` (if available)  
- `category` or another useful field for classification

## üß™ Test Structure

### ‚úÖ 1. Create a PHP Crawler

- Write a PHP script to scrape data from the website above.  
- The crawler must export the data in JSON format readable by Laravel.  
- You may use any library (cURL, Guzzle, Symfony DomCrawler, etc.).

### ‚úÖ 2. Laravel Backend ‚Äì Asynchronous Import

- Create a new Laravel project.  
- Create two Eloquent models:  
  - `Product`: representing the product  
  - `Image`: representing one or more associated images  
- Make sure to **properly manage the relationships between models**.  
- Create a `POST /api/import` route to receive JSON data from the crawler.  
- The import must be done **asynchronously**, using a **queue system** with a dedicated **Job**.

### ‚úÖ 3. Filament Admin Panel

- Install Filament in the project.  
- Create a Filament **Resource** (`ProductResource`) to:  
  - View all products  
  - Edit or delete records  
  - Display a preview image in the product list

### ‚úÖ 4. Dynamic Frontend ‚Äì Livewire + AlpineJS

- Create a page accessible at `/view/products`.  
- The page must:  
  - Display paginated products (25 per page, at least 2 pages)  
  - Allow sorting by date added or other criteria  
  - Be dynamic using **Livewire + AlpineJS**  
  - Have a clean and responsive style using **TailwindCSS**
